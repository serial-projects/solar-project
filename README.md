# Solar Project ☀️
Inspired on RPG Maker, this engine helps you making RPG games, it has a simple syntax and easy to learn configuration
files. This version is made in LUA/LOVE2D. But on the future, I might rewrite in C for more POWAH!!!

# Features
- Configuration files are written in SCF (Sectionized Configuration File) with a easy and very readable syntax.
- Solar ☀️ has commands, check the documentation for them, making scripting easier.
- If you don't like the commands, there are also Basil Language, which is friendly and powerful. (WIP).
- Saving API, Styling and Translation API.-
- Cross-platform and easy to distribute.
- LUA's speed.
